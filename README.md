# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
This config should work on both Windows and Linux if you have the required dependencies.
For Windows you may need to install a C compiler (I use Mingw).

Linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
```
Windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim
```
